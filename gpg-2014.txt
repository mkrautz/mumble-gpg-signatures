Mumble GPG keys
===============

(Last-Updated: 2014-01-04)

Mumble source tarballs (as well as some other products) are digitally signed via GPG.

This document lists the GPG keys that were used to sign various Mumble releases and
snapshots.

All products built in 2014
==========================

Starting at the beginning of 2014, all of our build products
(tarballs, zip files, MSI installers, DMG disk images) are GPG
signed, and have a detached GPG signature to go along with them.
Previously, only tarballs were signed.

The detached signatures are named <original-file-name>.sig, and
are ASCII-armoured.

The signing is entirely automatic, and happens inside the Mumble
build infrastructure.

The products are signed with the following GPG key:
