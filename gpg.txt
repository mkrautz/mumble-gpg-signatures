Mumble GPG keys
===============

(Last-Updated: 2016-01-01)

Mumble source tarballs (as well as some other products) are digitally signed via GPG.

This document lists the GPG keys that were used to sign various Mumble releases and
snapshots.

 - mkrautz (GPG: 41BCDD10)

All products built in 2016
==========================

All of our build products (tarballs, zip files, MSI installers,
DMG disk images) are GPG signed, and have a detached GPG signature
to go along with them.

The detached signatures are named <original-file-name>.sig, and
are ASCII-armoured.

Our downloads are available at the address https://dl.mumble.info.
For example, a released product called "product-1.0.tar.gz" would
be available at

    https://dl.mumble.info/product-1.0.tar.gz

and its detached signature would be available at

    https://dl.mumble.info/products-1.0.tar.gz.sig

The signing of our build products is entirely automatic, and happens
inside the Mumble build infrastructure.

Our build products are signed with the following GPG key:

pub   4096R/5A2BE0C1 2016-01-01 [expires: 2017-01-01]
      Key fingerprint = 3BD0 ECA5 9253 19AF 89C2  5865 B585 609C 5A2B E0C1
uid                  Mumble Automatic Build Infrastructure 2016 <mumble-auto-build-2016@mumble.info>

The key is available as "mumble-auto-build-2016.asc" in this Git repository.

All products built in 2015
==========================

All of our build products (tarballs, zip files, MSI installers,
DMG disk images) are GPG signed, and have a detached GPG signature
to go along with them.
