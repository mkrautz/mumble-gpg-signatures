Mumble GPG keys
===============

(Last-Updated: 2015-01-02)

Mumble source tarballs (as well as some other products) are digitally signed via GPG.

This document lists the GPG keys that were used to sign various Mumble releases and
snapshots.

 - mkrautz (GPG: 41BCDD10)

All products built in 2015
==========================

All of our build products (tarballs, zip files, MSI installers,
DMG disk images) are GPG signed, and have a detached GPG signature
to go along with them.

The detached signatures are named <original-file-name>.sig, and
are ASCII-armoured.

The signing is entirely automatic, and happens inside the Mumble
build infrastructure.

The products are signed with the following GPG key:

http://mumble.info/gpg/mumble-auto-build-2015.asc

pub   4096R/751B4695 2015-01-01 [expires: 2016-01-01]
      Key fingerprint = 710E 91FD F428 4F2E 69E0  DEBD D744 6C0F 751B 4695
uid                  Mumble Automatic Build Infrastructure 2015 <mumble-auto-build-2015@mumble.info>

All products built in 2014
==========================

All of the above is also true for products signed in 2014.

However, the 2014 products are instead signed with the following GPG key:

http://mumble.info/gpg/mumble-auto-build-2014.asc

pub   4096R/5FEF3A9A 2014-01-04 [expired: 2015-01-01]
      Key fingerprint = D32E 5D9E 01D2 FAF5 9D09  F62C ADD0 1104 5FEF 3A9A
uid                  Mumble Automatic Build Infrastructure 2014 <mumble-auto-build-2014@mumbleapp.com>
